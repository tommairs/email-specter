# Email Specter

**Email Specter** is a powerful log analysis and monitoring tool for [KumoMTA](https://github.com/kumocorp/kumomta), designed to help you track email delivery, diagnose issues, and optimize performance through real-time insights and
detailed reporting.

## Features

- Live email delivery and bounce analytics dashboard
- Event and message search with advanced filters
- Detailed reports for delivery, bounces, and more
- MTA connection management (webhooks)
- Top domains, services, and IPs with instant search

## Installation

We recommend using Ansible for setting up a basic Email Specter instance. You can find the Ansible playbook in the [ansible](https://github.com/maileroo/email-specter/tree/main/ansible) directory and has been tested with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/maileroo/email-specter.git
```

Next, install Ansible and the required dependencies:

```
sudo apt install ansible git -y;
ansible-galaxy install trfore.mongodb_install;
```

Then, fill out the inventory file with the required details. Generally, you will need to set the following variables:
Note that the email-spectre inventory file is located at `~/email-specter/ansible/inventory.yaml` and you can edit that file directly.

```
public_ip: "127.0.0.1"
```

Specify the public IP address of your server where Email Specter will be hosted and accessed from.

Finally, run the Ansible playbook to set up Email Specter:

```
cd email-specter/ansible/scripts;
chmod +x run.sh;
./run.sh;
```

This will install all necessary dependencies, configure Email Specter, and start the service.

After the playbook is complete, you can access Email Specter at <em>http://{{ public_ip }}/</em>.


## Setting this up manually
If you are looking to setup Email Specter manually, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies: 
   1. MongoDB 8.0  [Mongo instructions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)
   2. Node.js 22  ( `sudo apt install nodejs` )
   3. Go 1.24 ( `sudo apt install golang` )
2. Clone the GitHub repository ( `git clone https://github.com/maileroo/email-specter.git` )
3. Populate the .env file with the required environment variables (checkout ansible/templates/backend.env.j2 for a template)
4. Run the following commands to build and start Email Specter (using Go).
5. Go to `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.
6. Run `npm run build` to build the frontend.
7. Run `npm run start` to start the frontend server.
8. Go to `backend` directory and run `go build .` to build the backend executable.
9. Run `./email-specter` to start the backend server.

## Usage

Once Email Specter is installed and running, you can access it from your web browser at <em>http://{{ public_ip }}/</em>.

You will be prompted to create an admin user on the first visit. After that, you can log in with the credentials you set.
